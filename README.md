# Internshipt_code_Alpha_Data_Analyst
End-to-End Data Pipeline for IMDb Top Movies. Used Python, BeautifulSoup for scraping, Pandas for Cleaning/EDA, and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization. Key visuals include Actor Frequency and Year vs. Rating correlation. Demonstrates a complete analytical workflow.



# Code_Alpha_Data_Analytics_Intership: IMDb Top 25 Movies Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end Data Analytics project focused on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data from IMDb's list of the top-rated movies. It demonstrates essential skills in data acquisition, transformation, and visualization to derive clear, actionable insights.

## Key Tasks Completed

1.  **Web Scraping (Task 1):**
    * Used Python (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`) to scrape Rank, Title, Year, Rating, and **Main Cast** (deep scrape) for the Top 25 movies from the IMDb chart.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Cleaning (Task 2):**
    * Performed rigorous data cleaning (Pandas) to convert `Year` and `Rating` into numeric formats.
    * Conducted statistical analysis to find the mean, spread, and correlation between variables.
3.  **Data Visualization (Task 3):**
    * Created compelling visuals (Seaborn/Matplotlib) to present findings.

## Core Insights Visualized

* **Actor Frequency:** Bar chart showing the Top 10 most frequent actors in top-rated cinema.
* **Rating Distribution:** Box plot analyzing the statistical spread and median of the movie ratings.
* **Year vs. Rating:** Scatter plot demonstrating the relationship (correlation) between a movie's release year and its rating.
